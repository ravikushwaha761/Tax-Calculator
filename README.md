# Income Tax-Calculator
Overview
This Tax Calculator is designed to help users determine their tax liability based on their income, deductions, and age. The calculation follows a specific formula outlined below.

Tax Calculation Formula
Overall income (after deductions) under 8 Lakhs is not taxed.
For income over 8 Lakhs:
30% tax for individuals under 40 years of age.
40% tax for individuals aged 40 or above but under 60.
10% tax for individuals aged 60 or above.
Example
If an individual aged 34 has an income of 40 Lakhs with no deductions, the tax would be calculated as follows:

Income = 40 Lakhs

Tax = 0.3 * (40 - 8) = 0.3 * 32 = 9.6 Lakhs

Usage
Input fields are provided for Gross Annual Income, Extra Income, Deductions, and Age.
Error icons are displayed to the right of each number field. Hovering over the icon will show a tooltip indicating the error if any.
The age dropdown field has three values:
<40
≥ 40 & < 60
≥ 60
If any field is left empty upon submission, an error icon will be displayed, indicating the mandatory nature of the field.
Modal Display
Upon clicking the submit button, a modal will display showing the final tax calculation based on the provided inputs.

Note
Error icons are not visible by default and will only appear when there's an error in the corresponding input field.
Users are not restricted from entering incorrect values, but error indicators will prompt them to correct their input.
